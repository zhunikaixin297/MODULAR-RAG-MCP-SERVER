"""Abstract base class for VectorStore providers.

This module defines the pluggable interface for VectorStore providers,
enabling seamless switching between different backends (Chroma, Qdrant, Milvus, etc.)
through configuration-driven instantiation.

    """Abstract base class for VectorStore providers.
    
    All VectorStore implementations must inherit from this class and implement
    the upsert() and query() methods. This ensures consistent interface across
    different providers (Chroma, Qdrant, Milvus, etc.).
    
    Design Principles Applied:
    - Pluggable: Subclasses can be swapped without changing upstream code.
    - Observable: Accepts optional TraceContext for observability integration.
    - Config-Driven: Instances are created via factory based on settings.
    - Idempotent: upsert() operations should be safely repeatable.
