"""Recursive Splitter implementation using LangChain.

This module provides a recursive character-based text splitting strategy
that respects document structure (headers, code blocks) and splits text
hierarchically to maintain semantic coherence.

    This splitter uses LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to split text
    by trying different separators in order (paragraphs, sentences, words) while
    respecting Markdown structure elements like headers and code blocks.
    
    Design Principles Applied:
    - Pluggable: Implements BaseSplitter interface for factory instantiation.
    - Config-Driven: Reads chunk_size and chunk_overlap from settings.
    - Fail-Fast: Raises ImportError if langchain-text-splitters is not installed.
    - Graceful Degradation: Validates inputs and provides clear error messages.
    
    Attributes:
        chunk_size: Maximum size of each chunk in characters.
        chunk_overlap: Number of overlapping characters between chunks.
        separators: List of separators to try in order (defaults to Markdown-aware).
        
    Raises:
        ImportError: If langchain-text-splitters package is not installed.
