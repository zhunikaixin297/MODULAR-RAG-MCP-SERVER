"""File integrity checker for incremental ingestion.

This module provides SHA256-based file integrity tracking to enable incremental
ingestion. Files that have been successfully processed can be skipped on
subsequent ingestion runs.

Design Principles:
- Idempotent: Multiple ingestion runs of the same file are safe
- Persistent: SQLite-backed storage survives process restarts
- Concurrent: WAL mode enables concurrent read/write operations
- Graceful: Failed ingestions are tracked but don't block retries
